# Neutral gas
# ===========
# 1. Set solver to cvode, and enable preconditioning
# 2. Set neutral_model = 1
# 3. xout boundary conditions on Nn and Pn used to set neutral gas temperature. 
#    Remember: Pn = Nn * Tn[eV] / Tnorm  so 300K = 0.025eV gives Pn = 5e-5 if Nn=0.1 and Tnorm=50
# 4. You might want to reduce or remove the density source in [Ne] section
